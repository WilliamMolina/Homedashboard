# angular-pluggable-architecture
This is the code example for my article [Angular pluggable architecture?](https://paucls.wordpress.com/2018/05/10/angular-pluggable-architecture/), an Angular application that allows to dynamically plug functionality.

The application is a simple Dashboard with Widgets that are loaded
at runtime from external sources.

This repo contains:
- dahboard - An Angular CLI project that provides a widgets dashboard. To keep it simple all the logic in charge of dinamically fetching and compilings widgets is in the `dashboard.component.ts`.
- widgets-repo - External repository from where the widgets configuration and bundles are served. (for this demo it is only static content served via http-server).
- wiget-hello - An example of widget component containing nested sub-components.
- wiget-quotes - An example of widget component that uses a service to retrieve quotes from an API.
- widget-todays-date - Another widget component.

## Running the demo
- Build all widgets
```
./build_widgets.sh
```
- Start the widgets-repo
```
cd widgets-repo && yarn start
```
- Start dashboard app
```
cd dashboard && yarn start
```

## To do
- Support production build with AOT.
- Widgets with separated template and css files should be compiled and inlined during the bundle build. Configure rollup to do that or use ng-packagr.
